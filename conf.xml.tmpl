    This is the central configuration file for the database. If the database
    is running in a servlet-context, the configuration file will be read from
    the WEB-INF directory of the web application. Otherwise, the configuration
    is read from the directory specified by the exist.home system property.

            xupdate
    
    Any unique attributes specified can also be overridden using a Java system 
    property, typically specified on the command line, of the form:
    
        org.element.element....attribute
        
    where the nesting of the element names follows the structure of the 
    XML configuration document, as was shown above.
        
    For example, to override the value of the cache size to be 128MB you could
    specify:
    
        -Dorg.exist.db-connection.cacheSize=128M
        
    on your JVM startup command line or options.  Note that this only works 
    for unique, non-repeating elements, so you can't override things like 
    the transformer attribute element values or the XQuery module builtin 
    definitions, since they are not unique.

        Configures the database backend.
        
        - cacheSize:
            the maximum amount of memory to use for database page buffers.
            Each database file has an associated page buffer for B+-tree and
            data pages. However, the memory specified via cacheSize is shared
            between all page buffers. It represents an absolute maximum, which
            would be occupied if all page buffers were completely full.
            
            The cacheSize should typically not be more than half of the size of 
            the JVM heap size (set by the JVM -Xmx parameter). It can be larger 
            if you have a large-memory JVM (usually a 64bit JVM)
        
        - checkMaxCacheSize:
            specifies whether eXist should check the max cache size on startup 
            and reduce it if it is too large.
            
            This value should normally be set to true.
            
            Only set this value to false if:
            
                a) You know what you are doing!
                b) You have a JVM with tons of memory (typically using a 64-bit 
                   JVM, which is the scenario this setting is intended for).
                c) You are really sure you've complied with a) and b) above.
                
            Setting this value to false may cause memory issues which may lead to 
            database corruptions, since it disables the automated max cache size 
            checks! You have been warned! ;-)
            
        - collectionCache:
            maximum amount of memory (in megabytes) to use for collection caches.
            Memory calculation is just approximate. If your collections are very 
            different in size, it might be possible that the actual amount of 
            memory used exceeds the specified limit. You should thus be careful 
            with this setting.
        
        - database:
            selects a database backend. Currently, "native" is the only valid setting.
        
        - files:
            path to the directory where database files are stored.
        
        - pageSize:
            the size of one page on the disk. This is the smallest unit
            transferred from and to the database files. Should be a multiple of
            the operating system's file system page size (usually 4096).

        - nodesBuffer:
            size of the temporary buffer used by eXist for caching index
            data while indexing a document. If set to -1, eXist will use the
            entire free memory to buffer index entries and will flush the
            cache once the memory is full.

            If set to a value > 0, the buffer will be fixed to the given size.
            The specified number corresponds to the number of nodes the
            buffer can hold, in thousands. Usually, a good default could be
            nodesBuffer="1000".
    
         - cacheShrinkThreshold:
            The minimum number of pages that must be read from a
            cache between check intervals to be not considered for 
            shrinking. This is a measure for the "load" of the cache. Caches
            with high load will never be shrinked. A negative value means that
            shrinkage will not be performed.

		 - doc-ids:
            how document ids are managed by eXist. Takes the values
            "default" or "incremental".
            
            eXist assigns a unique, 32bit integer document id to every 
            document. When a document is deleted, its id will be freed 
            and reused for the next document stored. The disadvantage 
            of this approach is that document ids
            are not stable, i.e. one cannot be sure that the same document
            id will always identify the same document.

            If you need stable, incremental ids, set the option doc-ids to
            "incremental".

        Increase the buffer settings for elements_buffers and words_buffers if

            Settings for the journaling and recovery of the database. With 
            recovery enabled, the database is able to recover from an unclean
            database shutdown due to, for example, power failures, OS reboots, 
            and hanging processes. For this to work correctly, all database 
            operations must be logged to a journal file. 
                      
            - enabled:
                if this attribute is set to yes, automatic recovery is enabled.
            
            - journal-dir:     
                this attribute sets the directory where journal files are to be
                written. If no directory is specified, the default path is to
                the data directory.
            
            - size:
                this attributes sets the maximum allowed size of the journal 
                file. Once the journal reaches this limit, a checkpoint will be
                triggered and the journal will be cleaned. However, the database
                waits for running transactions to return before processing this
                checkpoint. In the event one of these transactions writes a lot
                of data to the journal file, the file will grow until the 
                transaction has completed. Hence, the size limit is not enforced
                in all cases.
            
            - sync-on-commit:
                this attribute determines whether or not to protect the journal
                during operating system failures. That is, it determines whether
                the database forces a file-sync on the journal after every 
                commit. 
                If this attribute is set to "yes", the journal is protected 
                against operating system failures. However, this will slow 
                performance - especially on Windows systems. 
                If set to "no", eXist will rely on the operating system to flush
                out the journal contents to disk. In the worst case scenario, 
                in which there is a complete system failure, some committed 
                transactions might not have yet been written to the journal, 
                and so will be rolled back.

            - group-commit:
                If set to "yes", eXist will not sync the journal file 
                immediately after every transaction commit. Instead, 
                it will wait until the current file buffer (32kb)
                is really full. This can speed up eXist on some systems 
                where a file sync is an expensive operation (mainly windows 
                XP; not necessary on Linux). However, group-comit="yes"
                will increase the risk of an already committed 
                operation being rolled back after a database crash.

            - force-restart:
                Try to restart the db even if crash recovery failed. This is
                dangerous because there might be corruptions inside the
                data files. The transaction log will be cleared, all locks removed
                and the db reindexed.
                
                Set this option to "yes" if you need to make sure that the db is
                online, even after a fatal crash. Errors encountered during recovery 
                are written to the log files. Scan the log files to see if any problems
                occurred.

            - consistency-check:
                If set to "yes", a consistency check will be run on the database
                if an error was detected during crash recovery. This option requires
                force-restart to be set to "yes", otherwise it has no effect.

                The consistency check outputs a report to the directory {files}/sanity
                and if inconsistencies are found in the db, it writes an emergency
                backup to the same directory.

                large output fragments.

            There are currently three options available:
            
            - org.exist.util.io.FileFilterInputStreamCache
                Default. Temporary binary streams are cached to a temporary file on disk.
            
            - org.exist.util.io.MemoryMappedFileFilterInputStreamCache
                Temporary binary streams are cached to a temporary file on disk which
                has been mapped into memory. Faster than FileFilterInputStreamCache.
                Not reliable on Windows platforms.
                
            - org.exist.util.io.MemoryFilterInputStreamCache
                Temporary binary streams are cached in memory.
                This is the fastest approach. However it can result in out of memory
                errors under heavy load or if using large binary files. 
            
           Where temporary files are used, they will be deleted after use.
           However, due to a bug in the JVM on Windows platforms, temporary files cannot be deleted, so instead
           they are re-cycled and re-used and deleted if the database is restarted.

            - type:
            The type of the job to schedule. Must be either "startup", "system" 
            or "user".
            
                startup - Startup jobs are executed once during the
                database startup but before the database becomes available,
                these jobs are synchronous.
                
                system - System jobs require the database to be in a consistent state.
                All database operations will be stopped until the method returns or 
                throws an exception. Any exception will be caught and a warning written to
                the log.
                
                user - User jobs may be scheduled at any time and may be mutually exclusive
                or non-exclusive
            
            - class:
            If the job is written in Java then this should be the name of the
            class that extends either -
                org.exist.scheduler.StartupJob
                org.exist.storage.SystemTask
                org.exist.scheduler.UserJavaJob
            
            - xquery:
            If the job is written in XQuery (not suitable for system jobs) then 
            this should be a path to an XQuery stored in the database. e.g. 
            /db/myCollection/myJob.xql
            XQuery job's will be launched under the guest account initially,
            although the running XQuery may switch permissions through
            calls to xmldb:login().
            
            - cron-trigger:
            To define a firing pattern for the Job using Cron style syntax
            use this attribute otherwise for a periodic job use the period
            attribute. Not applicable to startup jobs.
            
            - unschedule-on-exception:
            Boolean: yes/true, no/false. Default: true. If true and an exception is
            encountered then the job is unscheduled for further execution until a
            restart; otherwise, the exception is ignored.
            
            - period:
            Can be used to define an explicit period for firing the job instead
            of a Cron style syntax. The period should be in milliseconds.
            Not applicable to startup jobs.
            
            - delay:
            Can be used with a period to delay the start of a job. If unspecified jobs
            will start as soon as the database and scheduler are initialised.
            
            - repeat:
            Can be used with a period to define for how many periods a job should be
            executed. If unspecified jobs will repeat for every period indefinitely.

            Run a consistency check on the database. This will detect inconsistencies
            or corruptions in documents or the collection store. The task can also
            be used to create automatic backups. The backup routine is faster than
            the one in the standard backup tool and it tries to export as much data
            as possible, even if parts of the collection tree are destroyed.

            If errors are detected during the consistency check, the job will
            automatically start creating a backup.

            Errors are reported via the JMX object with the name:

        Default settings for the serializer. Most of these can be changed
        by client code:

        - add-exist-id:
            for debugging: add an exist:id attribute to every element, showing
            the internal node identifier (as a long int) assigned to this node.
            Possible values are: "none", "element", "all". "all" displays the 
            node of every element node; "element" displays the id only for the 
            root nodes of the returned XML fragments.
            
       - compress-output:
           should the output be compressed when serializing documents?
           Sometimes useful with remote clients.
           Remember to add a statement like this to your client code:
           service.setProperty("compress-output", "yes");
           to uncompress the retrieved result in the client too.
        
        - enable-xinclude: 
            should the database expand XInclude tags by default?
        
        - enable-xsl: 
            should the database evaluate XSL processing instructions
            when serializing documents?
        
        - indent:
            should the serializer pretty-print (indent) XML?
        
        - match-tagging-attributes:
            matches for attribute values can also be tagged using the character
            sequence "||" to demarcate the matching text string. Since this 
            changes the content of the attribute value, the feature is disabled
            by default.
        
        - match-tagging-elements:
            the database can highlight matches in the text content of a node by
            tagging the matching text string with <exist:match>. Clearly, this
            only works for XPath expressions using the fulltext index. 
            
            Set the parameter to "yes" to enable this feature.

        Default settings for the XSLT Transformer. Allow's for a choice of 
        implementation:
        
        - class:
            the name of the class that implements javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory
            
            for Saxon (XSLT 2.0 support):
            - "net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl"
            
            for Xalan (XSLT 1.0 support):
            - "org.apache.xalan.processor.TransformerFactoryImpl"

        - caching:
            You can enable or disable xsl caching by this option.     
            This option is set to "yes" by default.     
            
        For further details see - http://atomic.exist-db.org/wiki/HowTo/XSLT2/
        
        You can also include attribute child elements, if you wish to pass in 
        attributes to your particular TransformerFactory as follows:
        
            <transformer class="net.sf.saxon.TransformerFactoryImpl">
                <attribute name="http://saxon.sf.net/feature/version-warning" 
                           value="false" type="boolean"/>
            </transformer>
            
        The example above sets Saxon to suppress warnings when executing a 
        XSLT 1.0 stylesheet with the XSLT 2.0 processor. Check the 
        documentation for your selected TransformerFactory to determine which 
        attributes can be set. Valid types include "boolean", "integer" 
        and "string".  Anything else will be treated as type "string".
        
    -->

            effects depend on the parser you use. eXist comes with Xerces which 
            can validate against both: schemas and DTDs.

                eXist supports calls to arbitrary Java methods from within 
                XQuery. Setting to "yes" might introduce a security risk.
            -  disable-deprecated-functions:
                Set to "yes" to disable deprecated functions
            - enable-query-rewriting:
                Set to "yes" to enable the new query-rewriting optimizer. This 
                is work in progress and may lead to incorrect queries. Use at your
                own risk.
            -  backwardCompatible:
                Set to "yes" to enable backward compatibility (untyped argument 
                checks for instance)
            - enforce-index-use
                When set to "strict", eXist will not use a range index unless all
                collections in the context sequence define it. When set to
                "always", the query engine will still use an index, even if only
                one collection has it defined. It thus leaves it to the user to
                properly define indexes and if you forget to specify an index on
                a particular collection, it will be missing in the results.
            - raise-error-on-failed-retrieval
                Set to "yes" if a call to doc(), xmldb:document(), collection() or 
                xmldb:xcollection() should raise an error (FODC0002) when an 
                XML resource can not be retrieved.
                Set to "no" if a call to doc(), xmldb:document(), collection() or 
                xmldb:xcollection() should return an empty sequence when an
