This directory contains configuration and setup files for the IzPack installer. 

Adding Applications to the Distribution
=======================================

Beginning with eXist-2.0, the documentation and all examples are distributed as separate 
app packages. To change the list of apps available to the user, you have to do the following:

* Edit the second panel in userInput.xml and add a field with type "check" for each app
you want to present to the user. Specify a unique variable.

* Edit jobs.xml: in executefile, add an <arg> for every variable.

* Create a directory in $EXIST_HOME and copy the .xar files of all application
packages you want to have installed there.
