        <title>Production use - Good Practice</title>
        <abstract>
            <para>From our and our clients' experiences of developing and using eXist in production environments there are a number of lessons which we have learned. This Good Practice guide is an attempt to cover some of the considerations that should be taken into account when deploying eXist for use in a production environment.</para>
            <para>The concepts laid out within this document should not be considered absolute or accepted wholesale, more that they should be used as suggestions to guide users in their eXist deployments.</para>

            <title>The Server</title>
            <para>Ensure that your server is up-to-date and patched with any necessary security fixes.</para>
            <para>eXist is written in Java - so for performance and security reasons, please ensure that you have the latest and greatest Java JDK release installed. At present this is the 1.6 branch, details of the latest version can always be found here - <ulink url="http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</ulink></para>

            <title>Install from Source or Release?</title>
            <para>Most users will install an officially released version of eXist on their production systems, usually this is perfectly fine. However there can be advantages to installing eXist from source code on a production system.</para>
            <para>eXist may be installed from source code to a production system in one of two ways -</para>

                        <para>You checkout the eXist code for a release branch (or trunk) from our Subversion repository to a local machine, from here you build a distribution which you test and then deploy to your live server.</para>

                    <term>Directly from Subversion</term>
                    <listitem>In this case you dont use a local machine for building an eXist distribution, but you checkout the code for a release branch (or trunk) directly from our Subversion repository on your server and build it in-situ.</listitem>

            <para><caution><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> - eXists code trunk is generally not recommended for production use, whilst it should always compile and be relatively stable, it may also contain as yet unrecognised regressions or result in unexpected behaviour.</caution></para>

                <title>Upgrading</title>
                <para>If you are upgrading the version of eXist that you use in your production system, please always follow these two points -</para>

                    <para>At present eXist ships with fairly relaxed permissions to facilitate rapid application development, for production systems these should be constrained -</para>

                            <listitem>The default permissions for creating resources and collections in eXist are set in conf.xml. The current settings are fairly sane, but you may like to improve on them for your own application security.</listitem>

                    <title>Operating System Permissions</title>
                    <para>eXist should be deployed and configured to run whilst following the security best practices of the operating system on which it is deployed.</para>
                    <para>Typically we would recommend creating an "exist" user account and "exist" user group with no login priviledges (i.e. no shell and empty password), changing the permissions of the eXist installation to be owned by that user and group, and then running eXist using those credentials. An example of this on OpenSolaris might be -</para>
                    <programlisting language="bash">
$ pfexec groupadd exist
$ pfexec useradd -c "eXist Native XML Database" -d /home/exist -g exist -m exist

                <title>Attack Surface</title>
                <para>For any live application it is recognised best practice to keep the attack surface of the application as small as possible. There are two aspects to this -</para> 
                    <orderedlist>
                        <listitem>Reducing the application itself to the absolute essentials.</listitem>
                        <listitem>Limiting access routes to the application.</listitem>
                    </orderedlist>
                <para>eXist is no exception and should be configured for your production systems so that it provides only what you need and no more. For example, the majority of applications will be unlikely to require the WebDAV or SOAP Admin features for operation in a live environment, and as such these and other services can be disabled easily.

                    <varlistentry>
                        <term>Standalone mode</term>
                        <listitem>eXist can be operated in a cut-down standalone mode (see server.(sh|bat)). This provides just the core services from the database, no webapp filesystem access, and no documentation. The entire application has to be stored in the database and is served from there. This is an ideal starting place for a production system.</listitem>

                    <varlistentry>
                        <term>Services</term>
                        <listitem>eXist provides several services for accessing the database. You should reduce these to the absolute minimum that you need for your production application. If you are operating in Standalone mode, this is done via. server.xml, else see webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml. You should look at each configured service, servlet or filter and ask yourself - do we use this? Most production environments are unlikely to need WebDAV or SOAP Admin (Axis). </listitem>

            <para>eXist provides 3 different mechanisms for performing backups - </para>

            <para>Each of these backup mechanisms is schedulable either with eXist or with your operating system scheduler. See the <ulink url="backup.xml">backup</ulink> page and conf.xml for further details.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Web Deployments</title>
            <para>eXist like any Web Application Server (Tomcat, WebLogic, GlassFish, etc) should not be directly exposed to the Web. Instead, we would strongly recommend proxying your eXist powered Web Application through a Web Server such as <ulink url="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">Nginx</ulink> or <ulink url="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTPD</ulink>. See <ulink url="production_web_proxying.xml">here</ulink> for futher details.</para>
            <para>If you proxy eXist through a Web Server, then you may also configure your firewall to only allow external access directly to the Web Server. If done correctly this also means that web users will not be able to access any eXist services except your application which is proxyied into the Web Servers namespace.</para>
