        <section>
            <title>Overview</title>
            <para>In this section, we discuss eXist's security features and how to manage database
                users and groups. Beginning with version 0.9, the eXist database engine supports
                basic user authentication and access control. Unix users will find the format for
                these authentication and permission settings very similar to that of the Unix
                operating system. To make it easier to manage users and modify resource permissions,
                eXist provides an interactive interface to execute commands and perform
                administrative tasks, as discussed in the following sections. This interface is
                facilitated by the XML:DB service included with eXist.</para>
            <para>Every eXist database user has an account with a username, password and other
                information that is stored in the database. Furthermore, every user belongs to one
                or more groups - and respectively, every resource in the database is owned by a user
                and by a group. By default, the owner is set to the user who created the resource,
                and his primary group, but eXist allows for different permissions for the owner, the
                owner's group and others. However, only the owner of the resource (or <filename
                    >dba</filename> users) can change these permissions.</para>
            <para>User and group information is found in the designated XML file <filename
                    >/db/system/users.xml</filename> located in collection <filename
                    >/db/system</filename>. This file is generated during database startup. The
                following is a simple example of a <filename>users.xml</filename> document: </para>
            <example>
                <title><filename>users.xml</filename> User Information</title>
                <programlisting><markup><![CDATA[<auth>
    <groups last-id="3">
        <group name="dba" id="1"/>
        <group name="guest" id="2"/>
        <group name="mygroup" id="3"/>
    </groups>
    <users last-id="3">
        <user name="admin" uid="1" home="">
            <group>dba</group>
        </user>
        <user name="guest" uid="2" password="e55d929cdbc8d5a7ce3bda044bc69f59" home="">
            <group>guest</group>
        </user>
        <user name="user-1" uid="3" password="7f0261c14d7d1b8e51680a013daa623e" home="my-collection">
            <group>my-group</group>
        </user>
    </users>
</auth>]]></markup>
                </programlisting>
            </example>
            <para>As we see from this example, passwords are encrypted using an
                    <emphasis>MD5</emphasis> algorithm (e.g. <option>user-1</option> has the
                    <emphasis>MD5</emphasis>-encrypted password "7f0261c14d7d1b8e51680a013daa623e").
                Therefore, whenever a user enters his or her password, the database generates an MD5
                encryption and compares it to the encryption stored in <filename
                    >users.xml</filename>. Since it is very difficult for users to guess the
                original password from the MD5 string, passwords in eXist should be sufficiently
                secure.</para>
            <para>Note that the <filename>/db/system</filename> collection is (by default) only
                readable by <option>dba</option> users (although it is possible to make it
                accessible by other users). The <option>dba</option> group is specially reserved for
                database administrators, and only <option>dba</option> users are allowed to create
                or remove users, or change permissions for other users.</para>
            <important>
                <para>By default, access to an eXist database is disabled until a password is set
                    for the administrator (see <emphasis>Changing the Administrator
                        Password</emphasis> below for instructions). Since <option>write</option>
                    permissions for files are granted to everyone, it is important to be careful
                    about how you configure server access for users on a network or the
                    Internet.</para>

                                <para>When the database is started for the first time, two default
                                    users are created: &quot;admin&quot; and &quot;guest&quot;. (The
                                    &quot;admin&quot; user is a member of the <option>dba</option>
                                    group, and therefore has administrative privileges; the
                                    &quot;guest&quot; user is a member of the group
                                    &quot;guest&quot; and is not an administrator). At this inital
                                    point, the &quot;admin&quot; password is set to
                                        <option>null</option>, and so access to the database is
                                        <emphasis>initially</emphasis> granted to everyone. To set
                                    restrictions on database access, you must first set a password
                                    for the &quot;admin&quot; user. To do this, use either the
                                        <emphasis>Admin Client</emphasis> or the <ulink
                                        url="admin/admin.xql">administrative web interface</ulink>.
                                    If eXist is used for applications intended for online web
                                    publications, or as an embedded library, it is exposed it to
                                    potential exploitation. It is therefore strongly advised that
                                    you first change the admin password.</para>

                <step>

            <para>The other default user, &quot;guest&quot;, also has the password
                &quot;guest&quot;. The guest identity is internally assigned to all clients which
                have not authenticated themselves. For example, the Xincon WebDAV interface does not
                support authentication, so &quot;guest&quot; is assumed for its users by default.
                Note that this aspect of WebDAV is a potential source of confusion, and you have to
                be careful about setting read/write permissions for this API.</para>

            <title>Creating Users</title>
            <para>It is easy to create new users using the Admin Client. In the <guimenu>Edit
                    users</guimenu> dialog box, fill in the <option>Username</option>,
                    <option>Password</option>, <option>Password (repeat)</option>, and
                    <option>Home-collection</option> fields, and assign a group (or groups) for the
                new user. Finally, select <guimenuitem>Create User</guimenuitem>. The new user will
                appear in the list of users in the top panel.</para>
            <para>The <command>adduser</command> command also allows you to create additional users.
                The command asks for a password and a list of groups to which the user should
                belong. An example is shown below:</para>

            </example>
            <para>As shown on the left-hand side, the Admin Client displays resource permissions in
                a similar format to the output of the Unix <command>ls -l</command> command: a
                ten-character code. The first character represents the type of resource:
                    <option>-</option> [hyphen] for documents (files) and <option>d</option> for
                collections. The next three characters are the permissions for the user: a
                    <option>-</option> [hyphen] is used for denied permissions, <option>r</option>
                for read, <option>w</option> for write, and <option>u</option> for update. The next
                three characters (five through seven) set the permissions for groups, and the last
                three for others (i.e. anyone else who can access the database). Given the previous
                example, we can see that all files except <filename>r_and_j.xml</filename> are owned
                by user &quot;admin&quot; and group &quot;dba&quot;.</para>
            <para>As mentioned in the previous section, the database root collection <filename
                    >/db</filename> initially has permissions set to <option>drwurwurwu</option>,
                i.e. full access is granted to everyone. Also note that <option>-rwur-ur--</option>
                is the default setting for all newly created resources, i.e. the group has
                read/update permissions, but not write permissions; others are only allowed to
                read.</para>
            <para id="octal">Some XQuery functions expect to get the permissions as an octal number.
                The <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_permissions#Octal_notation"
                    >octal notation</ulink> is quite common on Unix systems. In eXist, the first 3
                bits correspond to the user permissions, the second 3 bits are for the group and the
                final 3 bits for others. In order to set the permissions to
                    <option>-rwur-ur--</option> you would need to specify <option>0754</option> in
                octal notation.</para>

                                        for the specified user, group, or other according to the
                                        following syntax:</para>
                                </listitem>
                            </orderedlist>
                            <synopsis>chmod [resource] [user|group|other]=[+|-][read|write|update][, ...]</synopsis>

                </variablelist>
                <para>For example, to grant the write permission to the group and deny all to
                    others, you may use:</para>
                <synopsis>chmod hamlet.xml group=+write,other=-read,-update,-write</synopsis>
                <para>If you do not specify a resource in the first argument of the <command
                        >chmod</command> command, the permission string will be applied to the
                    current collection. This is an important feature if you want to change
                    permissions for the <filename>/db</filename> root collection, which would
                    otherwise not be possible. For example, to deny write permissions to others for
                    the entire database, change directory to the root collection (i.e. enter
                        <command>cd ..</command>) and enter:</para>
                <synopsis>chmod other=-write</synopsis>

                <para>Only the owner has full control over a resource, and it is sometimes important
                    to change this ownership. The Admin Client provides the <command>chown</command>
                    command to do this. The command expects three arguments:</para>
