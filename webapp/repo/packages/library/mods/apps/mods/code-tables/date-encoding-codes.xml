            <label>iso8601</label>
            <value>iso8601</value>
            <description>This value is used for formatted dates allowed in ISO 8601 which use the alternative described as "basic" rather than "extended". This alternative specified in the standard uses the following date pattern: YYYYMMDD (hours, minutes, seconds may also be added). It is also used for other encodings specified in ISO 8601, e.g. date ranges, which are in the form of YYYY/YYYY (in which case start and end portions are not parsed). The ISO 8601 basic expression has been used widely in MARC 21 date elements.</description>

            <description>This value is used only for dates coded according to MARC 21 rules in field 008/07-14 for dates of publication/issuance. Thus, this would only apply to the attribute in dateIssued. Examples include: 19uu (a MARC convention to show unknown digits in a date), 9999 (a MARC convention showing that the end date has not occurred or is not known).</description>
