                If you click on the Folder View button, it will flip to a vertical position.

        <para>
                What you see in Folder View before you log in and after you log in differs in several respects. 
            </para>
        <para>
                Before you log in, you will only see three buttons below the grey bar. These are for expanding and collapsing the hierarchy of folders in the database that you can access as guest - and for reloading the list of folders, should any new folders have been added in the meantime. 
            </para>
        <para>
                Below that you will see the name of the base folder "mods", reflecting the fact that the records follow the MODS standard. All records in Tamboti are collected in this folder, so you will always start with this folder and burrow down to the folder you are interested in. 
            </para>
        <para>
                In front of the folder icon, there is a plus sign; if you click on it, the folder opens up - and the plus turns into a minus which allows you to close the folder again. 
                You may know this interface from Windows Explorer and elsewhere. 
        </para>
        <para>What the Folder View looks like after logging in will be shown later.</para>
