        <para> If only a single record satisfies your search criteria, a detail view of this record will be shown. If several records are found and you click
            one of them in the list view, the detail view for the record in question will be shown. </para>
        <para> If you click on "Switch to List View", you will be taken to the list view. </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/walk-through.08.png" align="center" valign="middle"/>
        </para>
        <para> In the detail view, you can see in which folder the record is located, opposite "In Folder:" </para>
        <para> In the detail view there are some buttons which reflect what you can do. If you have not logged in, this is not much. </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can add the record to a list of records the database remembers for you throughout the login session, a list which you can then
                    export. You access this list through the My List tab.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>You can also access the XML view of the record in question, that is the "raw" XML view of the MODS record, with all information enclosed by
                    tags. While this view is very informative, it is not easy to decipher. </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para> The detail view shows most of the contents of the records, but some of the information may not be displayed, because it is too complex or too prolix or because it is believed to lack
            relevance to most users. The XML view shows the unabridged view of a record. If you have saved a number of records and export them, the export
            format is also raw XML, but applications like EndNote and Zotero can import this format (in Citavi, this import function is still under
            development). This means that you can work with the records you find in Tamboti in ordinary desktop applications. </para>
