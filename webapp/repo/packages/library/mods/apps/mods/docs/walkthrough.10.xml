        <para> After you have logged in, the folders that are accessible to you have changed. First of all, you have a Home folder. When you click on your Home
            folder, note that the path shown in the search panel is not /mods/Home, but "/mods/" followed by your full username. </para>
        <para> The Home folder is represented in bold typeface. Folders with bold typeface are folders that you have rights to write to, this is, folders that you can save records in and folders the contents of which you can edit.
            If other users allow you to write to their folders, these folders will also appear in bold in the Folder View when you log in.
        </para>
        <para>
            All the other folders, that is, all the folders that have a light greyed-out appearance, are folders you can read only. You can retrieve the contents of these folders, but not change it or add new records to them.
        </para>
        <para>
            In addition to these two types of folders, there are many folders that you simply cannot see.
            These are folders that belong to other users that have not been made viewable by everyone by their owners or folders that have not been shared by their owner with a
            group that you are a member of. 
        </para>

        <para> By default, Tamboti comes with a number of sample records that illustrate different kinds of records. These you can treat as your own: at regular
            intervals the "samples" folder is restored to its original state, so you can do no (permanent) harm here. They are mainly of use when learning how to
            use the editor â€“ more about this later. </para>
