        <para> When you access Tamboti without logging in, you are able to search in the material that is open to everybody, to all "guests." </para>
        <para>When you have logged in, you can additionally search in material that is open to you alone and in material that is open to groups to which you
            belong.</para>
        <para>Even after you have logged log in, you will not see all material in the database, since it is likely that there are other users who keep at least
            some of their records private to themselves.</para>
        <para>The material that you wish to keep to yourself cannot be seen by anybody else, unless you choose to allow this. Below, it will be explained how
            you go about sharing your material, should you choose to do so.</para>
        <para>When searches are performed, only material open to a certain user is retrieved: the rest of the database could just as well be non-existent.
            Needless to say, the parts that outsiders cannot see cannot be edited by them. </para>
        <para>Though, generally speaking, it is hard to imagine why one would not want to share one's bibliographical records with everybody, Tamboti makes this
            possible. In other frameworks where we will apply the same user model, the benefits of this flexibility will be more evident.</para>
