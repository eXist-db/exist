        <para> If you click on your Home folder, you will see that two new buttons occur in the line above the folder hierarchy. </para>
        <para> One of them allows you to create a folder inside the folder that belongs to you <graphic fileref="../../../resources/images/folder_add.png" align="center" valign="middle"/>&#160;. If you have not created any folders yet, this will be your Home
            folder (unless someone has shared a folder with you, as "samples" are in the screen shot below). </para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/walk-through.11.1.png" align="center" valign="middle"/>
        </para>
        <para> If you select your Home folder and click this button, a dialogue window pops up, in which you can give a name to this folder. Please note that
            you cannot use spaces in the folder name (it is probably best to use underscores).</para>
        <para>
            <graphic fileref="images/walk-through.11.2.png" align="center" valign="middle"/>
        </para>
        <para> By default, Tamboti comes with a number of sample records that illustrate different kinds of records. These you can treat as your own: at regular
            intervals the "samples" folder is restored to its original state, so you can do no (permanent) harm here. They are mainly of use when learning how to
            use the editor; more about this later. </para>
        <para>If you create a new folder, you will see even more buttons. They will be explained in the next part.</para>
