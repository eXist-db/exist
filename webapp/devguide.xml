            <title>Overview</title>
            <para>This section provides a quick but broad introduction to the APIs and interfaces
                provided by eXist. We begin with an overview of how to configure eXist for XQuery to
                begin creating and executing <a href="devguide_xquery.xml">XQuery scripts</a> for web 
                applications. For this, we look
                at how eXist uses either the <application>XQueryServlet</application> servlet or
                    <application>XQueryGenerator</application> (Cocoon) to generate output from
                XQuery scripts. In section 3, we look at the basic 
                <a href="devguide_rest.xml">REST-style API</a> and its available
                HTTP request operations. Following that, in sections 4 and 5, we address Java
                programmers, and focus on the <a href="devguide_xmldb.xml">XML:DB API</a> - a standard 
                Java API used to access native
                XML database services - and its extensions. In sections 6 and 7, we discuss other
                ways to integrate eXist with Cocoon, including the XMLDBTransformer, and XSP
                Logicsheets. Sections 8 and 9 examine the network APIs for 
                <a href="devguide_xmlrpc.xml">XML-RPC</a> and its methods -
                this includes the use of XUpdate. <a href="devguide_soap.xml">SOAP interface</a> 
                is discussed as an alternative to
                XML-RPC in section 10. Finally, we include an important appendix of
                libraries required to implement specific APIs and interfaces.</para>
