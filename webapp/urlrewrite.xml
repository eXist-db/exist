        <title>URL Rewriting and MVC Framework</title>

        <abstract>
            <para>Since version 1.3/1.4, eXist provides a simple, yet powerful module for URL
                rewriting and redirection: XQueryURLRewrite. It also incorporates a basic MVC (Model
                View Controller) framework, offering servlet-based pipeline processing. The module
                was in part inspired by the existing Open Source packages UrlRewriteFilter and
                Spring MVC. The main difference is that we are not using any configuration files to
                configure the URL rewriting. XQueryURLRewrite is based on XQuery instead.</para>
        </abstract>

        <section>
            <title>Basics</title>

            <para>XQueryURLRewrite is a standard Java servlet filter. Like any other servlet filter,
                it is configured in <filename>webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</filename>. Its main job is to
                intercept incoming requests and forward them to the appropriate handlers, which are
                again standard servlets. In fact, there's nothing eXist-specific to the servlet
                filter, except that it uses XQuery scripts to configure the forwarding and URL
                rewriting.</para>

            <para>A controller XQuery is executed once for every requests. It should return an XML
                fragment, which tells the servlet filter how to proceed with the request. The
                returned XML fragment may just define a simple forwarding, or it could describe
                complex pipelines involving multiple steps.</para>

            <para>The main advantage of using XQuery for the controller is that we have the whole
                power of the language available for the URL rewriting. The controller can look at
                request parameters or headers, add new parameters or attributes, rewrite the request
                URI or access the database. There's basically no limit.</para>

        </section>

        <section>
            <title>URL Rewriting</title>

            <para>When designing RESTful web applications, a common rule is to provide meaningful
                URIs to the user. For example, our eXist wiki implements a hierarchical document
                space. The user can directly browse to a document by entering the path to it into
                the browser's location bar. The URL <ulink
                    url="http://atomic.exist-db.org/HowTo/OxygenXML/"
                    >http://atomic.exist-db.org/HowTo/OxygenXML/eXistXmlRpcChanged</ulink> will
                directly lead to the corresponding document.</para>

            <para>Internally, however, all document views are handled by the same XQuery script.
                Above URL will actually be forwarded to an XQuery called
                    <filename>index.xql</filename> as follows:</para>

            <synopsis>index.xql?feed=HowTo/OxygenXML/&amp;ref=eXistXmlRpcChanged</synopsis>

            <para>The XQuery code which does the rewrite magic is shown below:</para>

            <programlisting language="xquery"><![CDATA[
let $path := substring-after($uri, request:get-context-path())
let $params := subsequence(text:groups($path, '^/?(.*)/([^/]+)$'), 2)
return
    <dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
        <forward url="/index.xql">
            <add-parameter name="feed" value="{$params[1]}"/>
            <add-parameter name="ref" value="{$params[2]}"/>
        </forward>
    </dispatch>]]>
            </programlisting>

            <para>The forward element tells XQueryURLRewrite to pass the request to the specified
                URL, which is always interpreted relative to the context of the web application
                (e.g. /exist). You could also forward to a servlet instead of an URL by specifying
                its name (servlet="ServletName"). The forwarding is done via the
                    <classname>RequestDispatcher</classname> of the servlet engine and is thus
                invisible to the user. If you want the user to see the rewritten URL, you can
                replace the <sgmltag>forward</sgmltag> action with a <sgmltag>redirect</sgmltag>. A
                common use for <sgmltag>redirect</sgmltag> is to send the user to a default
                page:</para>

            <programlisting language="xquery"><![CDATA[if ($path eq '/') then
    <dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
    	<redirect url="index.xml"/>
    </dispatch>]]></programlisting>

            <para>If no action is specified within the dispatch element, the request will just be
                passed through the filter chain and will be handled the normal way. The same happens
                if the action is an element <sgmltag>ignore</sgmltag>. For example, the simplest
                controller script would consist of a single ignore:</para>

            <programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[
        <ignore xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
            <cache-control cache="yes"/>
        </ignore>]]></programlisting>

            <para>Most scripts in eXist return this if no other rule applies to a request.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
            <title>Locating Controller Scripts</title>

            <para>By convention, the controller XQueries should be called
                    <filename>controller.xql</filename>. XQueryURLRewrite will try to guess the path
                to the most-specific controller query by looking at the request path. For example,
                in the standard eXist distribution, the main controller file is located in
                    <filename>webapp/controller.xql</filename>, but there are other controllers in
                the subdirectories <filename>webapp/sandbox</filename> or
                    <filename>webapp/admin</filename>. If the servlet filter receives a request path
                    <uri>http://localhost:8080/exist/sandbox/</uri>, it will find the
                    <filename>controller.xql</filename> file in the <filename>sandbox</filename>
                directory and execute this controller instead of the main controller.</para>

            <para>It is also possible to store the controller XQuery into the database instead of
                the file system. This makes sense if you want to keep your entire web application
                within the db (which is a common approach). To make the servlet filter search for
                controllers within the database, just change the parameter <option>base</option> in
                the <filename>web.xml</filename> configuration of the web application:</para>

            <example>
                <title>Changing XQueryURLRewrite's base parameter in web.xml</title>
                <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<filter>
    <filter-name>XQueryURLRewrite</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.exist.http.urlrewrite.XQueryURLRewrite</filter-class>
    
    <init-param>
        <param-name>base</param-name>
        <param-value>xmldb:exist:///db</param-value>
    </init-param>
</filter>]]></programlisting>
            </example>

        <section>
            <title>MVC and Pipelines</title>

            <para>XQueryURLRewrite does more than just forward or redirect requests: the response
                can be further processed by passing it to a pipeline of views. "Views" are again
                just plain Java servlets. The most common use of a view would be to post-processes
                the XML returned from the primary URL, either through another XQuery or an XSLT
                stylesheet (XSLTServlet). XQueryURLRewrite passes the HTTP response stream of the
                previous servlet to the HTTP request received by the next servlet. Views may also
                directly exchange information through the use of request attributes (more on that
                below).</para>

            <para>You define a view pipeline by adding a <sgmltag>view</sgmltag> element to the
                    <sgmltag>dispatch</sgmltag> fragment returned from the controller. The
                    <sgmltag>view</sgmltag> element is just a wrapper around another sequence of
                    <sgmltag>forward</sgmltag> or <sgmltag>rewrite</sgmltag> actions.</para>

            <para>For example, most of the documentation that comes with eXist is written in the
                docbook format and needs to be send through an XSLT stylesheet
                    (<filename>webapp/stylesheets/db2html.xsl</filename>) to be transformed into
                HTML. This is done by returning the following <sgmltag>dispatch</sgmltag> fragment
                from <filename>webapp/controller.xql</filename>:</para>

            <programlisting language="XML"><![CDATA[<dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
	<view>
		<forward servlet="XSLTServlet">
			<set-attribute name="xslt.stylesheet" 
				value="stylesheets/db2html.xsl"/>
		</forward>
	</view>
    <cache-control cache="no"/>
</dispatch>]]></programlisting>

            <para>There's no forwarding action outside the view in this example, so the request will
                be handled by the servlet engine in the normal way. The response is then passed to
                XSLTServlet. A new HTTP POST request is created whose body is set to the response
                data of the previous step. XSLTServlet gets the path to the stylesheet from the
                request attribute "xslt.stylesheet" and applies it to the data.</para>

            <para>If any step in the pipeline generates an error or returns an HTTP status code
                &gt;= 400, the pipeline processing will stop and the response is send back to
                the client immediately. The same happens if the first step returns with an HTTP
                status 304 (NOT MODIFIED), which indicates that the client can use the version it
                has cached.</para>

            <para>We can also pass a request through more than one "view". The following fragment
                applies two stylesheets in sequence (code taken from
                    <filename>webapp/xquery/controller.xql</filename>):</para>

            <example>
                <title>Applying more than one stylesheet</title>
                <programlisting language="xquery"><![CDATA[if ($name eq 'acronyms.xql') then
	<dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
		<!-- query results are passed to XSLT servlet via request attribute -->
		<set-attribute name="xquery.attribute"
			value="model"/>
		<view>
			<forward servlet="XSLTServlet">
				<set-attribute name="xslt.input"
					value="model"/>
				<set-attribute name="xslt.stylesheet"
					value="xquery/stylesheets/acronyms.xsl"/>
			</forward>
			<forward servlet="XSLTServlet">
				<clear-attribute name="xslt.input"/>
				<set-attribute name="xslt.stylesheet" 
					value="stylesheets/db2html.xsl"/>
			</forward>
		</view>
	</dispatch>]]></programlisting>
            </example>

            <para>The example also demonstrates how information can be passed between actions.
                XQueryServlet - which is called implicitely because the URL ends with ".xql" - can
                save the results of the called XQuery to a request attribute instead of writing them
                to the HTTP output stream. It does so if it finds a request attribute
                    <option>xquery.attribute</option>, which should contain the name of the
                attribute the output should be saved to.</para>

            <para>In the example above, <option>xquery.attribute</option> is set to "model". This
                causes XQueryServlet to fill the request attribute <option>model</option> with the
                results of the XQuery it executes. The query result will not be written to the HTTP
                response as you would normally expect. The HTTP response body will just be
                empty.</para>

            <para>Likewise, XSLTServlet can take its input from a request attribute instead of
                parsing the HTTP request body. The name of the request attribute should be given in
                attribute <option>xslt.model</option>. XSLTServlet discards the current request
                content (which is empty anyway) and uses the data in the attribute's value as input
                for the transformation process.</para>

            <para>XSLTServlet will always write to the HTTP response. The second invocation of
                XSLTServlet thus needs to read its input from the HTTP request body which contains
                the response of the first servlet. Since request attributes are preserved throughout
                the entire pipeline, we need to clear the <option>xslt.input</option> with an
                explicit call to clear-attribute.</para>

            <para>What benefits does it have to exchange data through request attributes? Well, we
                save one serialization step: XQueryServlet directly passes the node tree of its
                output as a valid XQuery value, so XSLTServlet does not need to parse it
                again.</para>

            <para>The advantages become more obvious if you have two or more XQueries which need to
                exchange information: XQuery 1 can use the XQuery extension function
                request:set-attribute() to save an arbitrary XQuery sequence to an attribute. XQuery
                2 then calls request:get-attribute() to retrieve this value. It can directly access
                the data passed in from XQuery 1. No time is lost with serializing/deserializing the
                data.</para>

            <para>Let's have a look at a more complex example: the XQuery sandbox web application
                needs to execute a user-supplied XQuery fragment. The results should be retrieved in
                an asynchronous way, so the user doesn't need to wait and the web interface remains
                usable.</para>

            <para>Older versions of the sandbox used the <function>util:eval</function> function to
                evaluate the query. However, this has side-effects because util:eval executes the
                query within the context of another query. Some features like module imports will
                not work properly this way. To avoid util:eval, the controller code below passes the
                user-supplied query to XQueryServlet first, then post-processes the returned result
                and stores it into a session for later use by the ajax frontend:</para>

            <example>
                <title>Post-processing the results of an XQuery with a second XQuery</title>
                <programlisting language="xquery"><![CDATA[if (starts-with($path, '/sandbox/execute')) then

            </example>

            <para>The client passes the user-supplied query string in a request parameter, so the
                controller has to forward this to XQueryServlet somehow. Fortunately, XQueryServlet
                has an option to read the XQuery source from a request attribute,
                    <option>xquery.source</option>. The query result will be saved to the attribute
                    <option>results</option>. The second XQuery, <filename>session.xql</filename>,
                takes the result and stores it into a HTTP session, returning only the number of
                hits and the elapsed time.</para>

            <para>When called through retrieve, <filename>session.xql</filename> looks at parameter

            <title>Controller XML Format</title>

            <para>A controller XQuery is expected to return a single XML element:

                                        reads <option>url="/admin"</option>, the resulting path will

                            of input URIs to dispatch rules. With the cache enabled, the controller
                            XQuery does only need to be executed once for every input URI.

            <para>eXist's XQueryServlet as well as the XSLTServlet will listen to a few, predefined
                request attributes. The names of those attributes are listed below and should not be

                            <para>Should contain the name of a request attribute, if set. Instead of
                                writing query results to the response output stream, XQueryServlet
                                will store them into the named attribute. The value of the attribute
                                will be an XQuery Sequence
                                    (<classname>org.exist.xquery.Sequence</classname>). If no query
                                results were returned, the attribute will contain an empty
                                sequence.</para>

                                given in the request path. <option>xquery.source</option> is a way
                                to overwrite this behaviour, e.g. if you want to evaluate an XQuery
                                which was generated within the controller.</para>

                <para>XSLTServlet will attempt to map all other request attributes starting with the
                    prefix <option>xslt.</option> into <emphasis>stylesheet parameters</emphasis>.
                    So, for example, if you set a request attribute <option>xslt.myattr</option> it
                    will be available within the stylesheet as parameter
                        <option>$xslt.myattr</option>. For security reasons, this is the only way to
                    pass request parameters into the stylesheet: use the controller query to
                    transform the request parameter into a request attribute and pass that to the
                    view.</para>

                <para>However, depending on the XSLT engine used, automatic conversion of types
                    between eXist/Java and the XSLT processor may not always work. It might be good
                    to limit your attribute values to nodes or strings.</para>
