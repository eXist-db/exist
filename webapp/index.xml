            <p>eXist is an Open Source native XML database featuring efficient, index-based <a
                    href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XQuery</a> processing, automatic structural indexing,
                extensions for full-text search, <a
                    href="http://xmldb-org.sourceforge.net/xupdate/">XUpdate</a> support,
                XQuery <a href="update_ext.xml">update extensions</a> (based on an early draft of 
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update-10/">XQuery Update Facility 1.0</a>) and tight integration with
                existing XML development tools. The database implements most of the current
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery/">XQuery 1.0 recommendation</a>,
                with exception of the schema import and schema validation features
                defined as optional in the XQuery specification.</p>

            <p>eXist provides a powerful environment for the development of web applications
                based on XQuery and related standards. Entire web applications can be written 
                in XQuery, using XSLT, XHTML, CSS and maybe Javascript (for AJAX functionality). XQuery 
                server pages can be executed from the filesystem or stored in the database.</p>

            <p> To avoid memory-intensive document tree traversals during query processing, eXist
                uses an efficient structural index structure which is based on a numerical indexing scheme for
                identifying XML nodes in the index.</p>

            <p>Versions <option>1.0</option> and <option>1.1</option> were published simultaneously. This situation
            was special in the sense that there has been a real technology switch between the two releases. The
            1.1 code replaces the old indexing scheme at the core of the database by a new one. The <b>new indexing 
            scheme</b> fixes some limitations eXist previously had. In particular, it</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>drops the previous document size/complexity limit</li>
                <li>removes the need to reindex a document after every node update</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>So if you ever had trouble with large documents or slow XUpdates, you should
            definitely have a look at the 1.1 version. For a discussion of the two schemes, have
                a look at our <a href="xmlprague06.xml">XML Prague article</a> 
                (<a href="http://wiki.exist-db.org/space/XMLPrague2006/wolfgangs_talk.pdf">slides</a>).</p>

            <note>
                <p><b>Even</b> release numbers (1.0.x, 1.2.x) indicate 'production' releases
                whose code has been tested for a longer time but are frozen except for important bug fixes.
                <b>Odd</b> releases (1.1.x, 1.3.x) are created from the active branch of development and
                contain all features and bug fixes.</p>
            </note>

            <p>Release <b>1.2</b> (currently being developed as 1.1.2dev) is a production quality
                release which has lot's of new features, improved stability and
                XQuery 1.0 compliancy as indicated by the w3c
                <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/test-suite/">XQTS</a> results. </p>

            <p>Release <b>1.3</b> will become the new development release. New features will be
            added to this release only. This version of eXist-db will require Java5 or later.</p>
