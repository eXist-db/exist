        <section id="sect1">
            <title>Introduction</title>
            <para>This guide offers the quickest way to install and begin using the eXist XML
                Database system. Although this guide assumes users have a basic knowledge of XQuery
                and XML, eXist can be used as a tool for learning these technologies. However, it is
                recommended that users consult other reference and tutorial resources. Some useful
                resources are suggested at the end of this document. </para>
        </section>
        <section id="sect2">
            <title>Installing eXist</title>
            <para>To begin, download the <ulink url="http://exist-db.org/download.html">latest
                    standard distribution</ulink> of eXist. This package is recommended for new
                eXist users and includes a graphical installer that guides you through the
                installation process. This standard distribution comes as an executable
                    <filename>.jar</filename> (Java Archive) file, which automatically determines
                the correct system settings (i.e. paths and environment variables) for eXist. On
                Windows and Linux Operating Systems, the installer can also create desktop
                shortcuts.</para>
            <para>Once the download has completed, start the eXist installation by doing
                    <emphasis>ONE</emphasis> of the following:</para>
            <procedure>
                <step>
                    <para>For Windows and Mac users, double-click on the installer file: <filename>
                            eXist-[version]-build-XXXX.jar</filename></para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>OR enter the following Java command in a Unix shell or Windows command
                        prompt using the <command>-jar</command> option:</para>
                </step>
            </procedure>
            <synopsis format="linespecific">java -jar eXist-[version]-build-XXXX.jar</synopsis>

            <para>This will launch the installer. Simply follow the steps to complete the
                installation process.</para>
	    <note>
	      <para>If you are on the mac platform the admin password asked for during the install procedure is not the mac-osx-admin pasword but for the eXist admin user alone.
	      </para>
	    </note>
	    <note>
	      <para>NB! You are strongly encouraged to set the admin password on all installations, even those without internet access, otherwise the eXist security manager will be disabled.
	      </para>
	    </note>
            <note>
                <para>To run the eXist installer package, ensure that <ulink
                        url="http://java.sun.com/downloads/">JDK (Java Platform)</ulink> 1.4.2 or
                    later is installed on your operating system.</para>
            </note>
            <note>
                <para>The eXist installer requires a graphical desktop in order to launch. However,
                    If you wish to install eXist on a headless system, use the <command>-p</command>
                    parameter when following <emphasis>Option Two</emphasis> above. This will
                    automatically start the installation. Option <command>-p</command> expects a
                    single parameter: the path to the directory where you would like to install
                    eXist. For example:</para>
                <synopsis>java -jar eXist-{version}.jar -p /usr/local/exist</synopsis>

        <section id="sect3">
            <title>Getting Started</title>
            <para>After the installation has completed, you should now be ready to launch eXist. If
                the installer has created shortcuts, simply double-click on the <emphasis>eXist
                    Database Startup</emphasis> icon or select this item from the start menu located
                on the desktop. </para>
            <para>To start eXist manually, do the following:</para>
            <procedure>
                <step>
                    <para>Open a Unix shell or DOS command prompt</para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>Change to the directory where you installed eXist</para>
                </step>
                <step>
                    <para>If you are a Unix user, enter the following:</para>
                    <synopsis format="linespecific">bin/startup.sh</synopsis>
                    <para>If you are a Windows user, enter the following:</para>
                    <synopsis format="linespecific">bin\startup.bat</synopsis>
                </step>
            </procedure>

            <para>If these scripts do not launch eXist, you can load it directly with the bootstrap
                loader by entering the following into the console:</para>
            <synopsis>java -Xmx128M -Djava.endorsed.dirs=lib/endorsed -jar start.jar jetty</synopsis>
            <note>
                <para>If you have problems understanding or running the shell/batch scripts, read
                <ulink url="#appendix">Running Executable Files</ulink> below.</para>
            </note>
            <para>While eXist starts up, log output might appear in the console. If eXist was
                launched properly, you should see the following:</para>

            <title>Using the Java Admin Client</title>

            <para>In addition to the web-based eXist interface, eXist provides a Java-based admin

            <para>This GUI client can be used either as a graphical interface, or through a DOS or
                Unix command-line - which uses parameter options for specific tasks. If no action is
                specified on the command-line, the client will enter "interactive mode" and display
                a graphical login interface. Additional information on using the admin client from
                the command line, is available in the <ulink url="client.xml">client

                    <para>To specify the username and password, pass the <parameter>-u</parameter>
                        and <parameter>-p</parameter> parameters on the command-line. By default,
                        the command attempts to shut down the database running at the default URI:
                        xmldb:exist://localhost:8080/exist/xmlrpc/db. To shutdown a different
                        database, use the corresponding URI and the <parameter>-l</parameter>

                <para>If eXist has been deployed as a web application in a web server other than the
                    supplied Jetty server, calling shutdown will close the database instance, but
                    not the server process of the web server. Since eXist does not know in which
                    environment it is running, it can only close itself. Regardless, closing the
                    database explicitly is always a good idea.</para>

            <para>Instead of manually running the eXist server in a shell window, you may prefer to
                run it as a background service which is automatically launched during system
                startup. eXist comes with pre-configured scripts that use Tanuki Software's <ulink
                    url="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org">Java Service Wrapper</ulink> to handle
                the setup procedure. The required scripts are contained in the directory
                    <filename>tools/wrapper</filename>. On Windows, you can simply choose the option
                to <emphasis>Install eXist as Service</emphasis> from the eXist menu created in the
                start menu. You can also call <filename>tools/wrapper/bin/install.bat</filename>
                instead. This will install eXist and Jetty as a Windows service.</para>

            <note>
                <para>Installing eXist as a service on Windows Vista requires full administrator rights.

            </note>
            
            <para>After executing the install.bat script, you should find eXist listed in the
            list of services currently registered with Windows:</para>

            <para>Once the service is registered, you can launch it via the service manager as
            shown in the screenshot or from the command line:</para>

                file from the <filename>init.d</filename> directory of your distribution (where all
                of the start/shutdown scripts reside). Normally, the directory will be
                    <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>. For example:</para>

            <synopsis>ln -s $EXIST_HOME/tools/wrapper/bin/exist.sh /etc/init.d/exist</synopsis>

            <para>You can then add the service to the correct system runlevel. Check with your Linux
