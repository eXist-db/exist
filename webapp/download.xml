            <para>Release <emphasis>1.4</emphasis> will be our next production quality release. It
                is currently available as a <emphasis>release candidate</emphasis>. Among other
                things, this release improves eXist's XQuery processing thanks to a better and more
                robust handling of in memory documents. It features faster and customizable full
                text indexing by transparently integrating Lucene into the XQuery engine. eXist now
                also provides a lightweight URL rewriting and MVC framework (which in part replaces
                Cocoon), along with support for XProc, XForms and many new XQuery extension
                modules.</para>

            <para>The final 1.4 release will replace the current <emphasis>1.2</emphasis> series as
                stable branch. Release <emphasis>1.5</emphasis> becomes the new <ulink
                    url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge">bleeding edge</ulink>
                development release. New features will be added to this release only.</para>

            <note>
                <para><emphasis>Even</emphasis> release numbers (1.0.x, 1.2.x) indicate 'production'
                    releases whose code has been tested for a longer time but are frozen except for
                    important bug fixes. <emphasis>Odd</emphasis> releases (1.1.x, 1.3.x) are
                    created from the active branch of development and contain all features and bug
                    fixes.</para>
