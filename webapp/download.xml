            <para>The current release <emphasis>1.2</emphasis> is a production quality release which has lot's of new
                features, improved stability and XQuery 1.0 compliancy as indicated by the w3c <ulink
                    url="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/test-suite/">XQTS</ulink> results. It has been
                derived from the <emphasis>1.1</emphasis> branch.</para>

            <para>Release <emphasis>1.3</emphasis> is the <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge"
                    >bleeding edge</ulink> development release. New features will be added to this
                release only. This version of eXist-db will require <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">Java5</a> or later.</para>

            <note>
                <para><emphasis>Even</emphasis> release numbers (1.0.x, 1.2.x) indicate 'production' releases whose
                    code has been tested for a longer time but are frozen except for important bug
                    fixes. <emphasis>Odd</emphasis> releases (1.1.x, 1.3.x) are created from the active branch of
                    development and contain all features and bug fixes.</para>
