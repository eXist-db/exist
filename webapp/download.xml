            <para>Release <emphasis>1.4</emphasis> is our current production quality release. Among
                other things, it improves eXist's XQuery processing thanks to a better and more
                robust handling of in memory documents. It features faster and customizable full
                text indexing by transparently integrating Lucene into the XQuery engine. eXist now
                also provides a lightweight URL rewriting and MVC framework (which in part replaces
                Cocoon), along with support for XProc, XForms and many new XQuery extension
                modules.</para>
            <para>1.4 replaces the <emphasis>1.2</emphasis> series as stable branch. Release
                    <emphasis>1.5</emphasis> becomes the new <ulink
