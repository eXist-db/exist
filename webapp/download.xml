            <title>eXist-db versions</title>

            <p>The current release <b>1.2</b> is a production quality release which has lot's of new
                features, improved stability and XQuery 1.0 compliancy as indicated by the w3c <a
                    href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Query/test-suite/">XQTS</a> results. It has been
                derived from the <b>1.1</b> branch.</p>

            <p>Release <b>1.3</b> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge"
                    >bleeding edge</a> development release. New features will be added to this
                release only. This version of eXist-db will require <b>Java5</b> or later.</p>

            <p>The previous versions <option>1.0</option> and <option>1.1</option> were published
                simultaneously. This situation was special in the sense that there has been a real
                technology switch between the two releases. The 1.1 code replaced the old indexing
                scheme at the core of the database by a new one. The <b>new indexing scheme</b>
                fixes some limitations eXist previously had. In particular, it</p>

            <ul>
                <li>drops the previous document size/complexity limit</li>
                <li>removes the need to reindex a document after every node update</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For a discussion of the two schemes, have a look at our <a href="xmlprague06.xml">XML
                    Prague article</a> (<a
                    href="http://wiki.exist-db.org/space/XMLPrague2006/wolfgangs_talk.pdf"
                >slides</a>).</p>

            <note>
                <p><b>Even</b> release numbers (1.0.x, 1.2.x) indicate 'production' releases whose
                    code has been tested for a longer time but are frozen except for important bug
                    fixes. <b>Odd</b> releases (1.1.x, 1.3.x) are created from the active branch of
                    development and contain all features and bug fixes.</p>

                <p>eXist-db versions <b>1.0.x</b>, <b>1.1.x</b> and <b>1.2.x</b> require at least
                    java <b>1.4.2</b>. Starting with eXist-db version <b>1.3.x</b>, at least
                    <b>Java5</b> is required. The database has been implemented and tested with the
                    Java implementation of Sun. Implementations of other vendors will probably work
                    but has not been tested.</p>

                <p>eXist-db heavily depends on the Apache <a
                        href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces2</a> parser, Apache <a
