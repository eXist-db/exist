                <p> The numbering scheme at the core of eXist 1.0 did limit the maximum size of a
                    document to be stored within the database. In eXist releases 1.1 and later this
                    is fixed.</p>

                <p>The current organization of collections and resources causes a number of problems
                    with respect to (a) locking, (b) query performance, (c) update performance.
                    Right now, documents are tightly bound to the collection in which they are
                    contained. Any operation on a document has to go through its parent collection.
                    As a result, locking and access control becomes quite complex as we need to take
                    care of the document and the collection.</p>

                <p>There's also a direct dependency between the size of a collection (in terms of
                    the number of documents stored in it) and document update speed. If a collection
                    has a large number of documents, removing a single document becomes very
                    slow.</p>

                <p>This problem can be solved by physically decoupling documents and
                    collections:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>a collection should be modelled as a logical unit, not a physical one.</li>
                    <li>current integer document ids should be replaced by hierarchical ids, which
                        model the entire collection/document path.</li>
                    <li>the link between the resource and the collection is only done through the
                        hierarchical document id.</li>
                    <li>locking and access control should be delegated to a central lock manager,
                        which just contains a map DocumentProxy -> Lock</li>
                </ul>

                <p>eXist currently uses 2 DOM (document object model) implementations: one for nodes
                    stored in the db, and a different one for in-memory nodes constructed during an
                    XQuery. The two models can not be mixed. To process an XQuery expression on an
                    in-memory node, the query engine needs to create a temporary persistent copy.
                    This costs performance and did cause stability issues in the past.</p>

                <p>To solve those problems, we are currently redesigning the in-memory DOM to
                    implement the same interfaces as the persistent DOM. The query engine should be
                    able to mix nodes of both models.</p>

                <p class="update">The current SVN trunk can directly evaluate XQuery expressions on
                    the in-memory DOM, which solves all previous issues and contributes to the
                    overall stability of the db. Refer to <a

        <remark>
            <p>Since version 1.2, there are now alternative index configuration methods which
                support the optimizer in rewriting a query for best performance. A new modularized
                indexing architecture allows to plug in arbitrary new indexes into the indexing
                pipeline. A N-gram and a spatial index module were added as prototypes to test the
                new architecture.</p>
            <p>There will be other index types added in the future, for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> combined path indexes to speed up frequently-used XPath expressions</li>
                <li>indexes to support operations on atomic-values, e.g. in order-by expressions or
                    the distinct-values function</li>
                <li>integration of specialized, external index types like the spatial index module
                    mentioned above.</li>

                <p>The grammar for the full text extensions has already been merged into the XQuery

            <remark>
                <p>When dealing with texts in many non-European languages, the token-based full-text
                    index produces insufficient results. Tokenization is currently based on Unicode
                    code points. Most chinese characters, for example, are thus stored as single
                    tokens. Users have to abuse the near() or phrase() function to search for
                    character sequences consisting of more than one character, which is quite slow.
                    It also means that real proximity searches are not available.</p>
                <p> An N-gram based index would be much more suitable for these languages. It would
                    also allow additional functionality to be implemented, e.g. to deal with varying
                    spellings. The main question is how the N-gram index would integrate
                    conceptually with the existing full-text functions.</p>
                <p class="update">A N-gram index based on the new modularized indexing architecture
                    is in SVN trunk as of July 2007 and in eXist 1.2 and later releases.</p>

            <p>The journal log and the recovery manager should be stable and are covered by
                extensive tests. However, recovery failures can not be excluded entirely. The tests
                can't reproduce every possible real-world scenario.</p>
            <p>However, some steps remain for eXist to become a fully transactional database system.
                Transaction support is currently limited to the functionality needed for crash
                recovery. Though we maintain transactions internally, they are currently not exposed
                to applications. Also, read operations are not transactional right now.</p>
            <p>In order to allow user-defined ACID transactions with support for rollback, all index
                files would need to be protected by the journaling log. The required functionality
                is basically available, but the feature is currently not regarded as
                high-priority.</p>

                <p>eXist's XQuery Update Extensions were implemented before the first W3C drafts
                    were published. The differences between the W3C recommendation and our
                    implementation are not that big, though there are some subtle differences
                    concerning the processing model. In fact, the recommendation simplifies a few
                    issues.</p>

            <p>The currently implemented Unix-like access control scheme is sufficient to protect
                resources and collections in a multi-user environment. However, it might be too
                coarse-grained for some types of applications. A more dynamic ACL implementation
                could help here. Right now, security management forms part of the database core.
                This is unnecessary. A more modular architecture would allow different security
                managers to be plugged in. It would be the responsibility of the security manager
                implementation to handle ACL lists.</p>
            <p>Since version 1.1, eXist supports the XACML standard for fine-grained access control
                to stored XQueries, Java classes etc.</p>

            <p>The XQuery engine as well as the standard function libraries should be updated to
                align with the XQuery 1.0 recommendation. Basically, almost all core language
                features are implemented, excluding schema related features, which are currently
                beyond eXist's scope.</p>
            <p>XQuery support in eXist is covered by the official W3C XQuery Test Suite (XQTS) 1.02.
                Implementing the official XQTS XQuery test suite was a top priority in order to
                guarantee standard conformance and avoid future regressions.</p>

                <p>With the 1.2 release, eXist features a new query-rewriting optimizer. It analyzes
                    the query at compile time and searches for optimizable subexpressions within the
                    query tree. If it finds an optimizable expression, the optimizer will modify the
                    query and wrap some special instructions around the optimizable code block.
                    Together with the new indexing features (see <a
                        href="http://atomic.exist-db.org/wiki/blogs/eXist/NewIndexing">blog
                        article</a>, the optimizer can achieve dramatic improvements.</p>

                <p>However, the optimizer is currently limited to predicate expressions. It does not
                    optimize e.g. "where" clauses in a FLWOR statement. The query-rewriting should
                    thus be extended to recognize other types of expressions beyond predicate
                    statements. In short, we need a better static analysis of the query.</p>

                <p>Based on eXist's current indexes, it is also often difficult to decide if a
                    certain optimization path leads to performance improvements or not. Better index
                    statistics could help here. Also, there's a wide range of performance
                    optimizations which could be applied if we had appropriate statistics on node
                    distribution and frequency.</p>

                <p class="update">As of Oct 2008, the current trunk has a statistics module, but it
                    is not yet used for real optimizations.</p>

                <p> eXist already provides a util:catch() function which basically corresponds to a
                    Java try-catch. The XQuery 1.1 draft also defines try-catch, but more closely

                <p>A nearly finished implementation of the XQuery API for Java (XQJ) is available in
                    SVN. It was started as a Google Summer of Code project in 2007 and provides two
                    XQJ drivers, one for embedded database access, one for remote access.</p>

                <p>I recently invested some time to bring the branch into sync with the current
                    trunk. The remote database driver, which is based on the REST-style HTTP
                    interface of eXist, should already be pretty usable. The embedded driver needs
                    some redesign though (it breaks the test suite). However, it should not be too
                    much work to fix this and finally merge it into trunk. Open Tasks:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>integrate the official XQJ test suite</li>
                    <li>test for standard conformance</li>
                    <li>fix the embedded database driver</li>
                    <li>merge into trunk</li>
                    <li>performance tests</li>
                </ul>

                <p> Some time ago we did a major rewrite of the sandbox application: <a
                        href="http://demo.exist-db.org/sandbox2/sandbox.xql"
                        >http://demo.exist-db.org/sandbox2/sandbox.xql</a> It is nearly usable, but
                    the syntax-highlighting editor component is limited. In particular, it has no
                    support for safari. Also, the sandbox still uses util:eval to execute the
                    entered XQuery code. This works well for simple queries, but can have
                    side-effects if the query imports external modules or tries to access the http
                    context. For the purpose of the sandbox, it would be better to post the
                    user-supplied query to a dedicated servlet, which executes the code and sends
                    back a result. </p>

                    version 1.2 is released.</p>
                <p>This will make some more stuff easier. Especially since the jmx monitors and
                    junit 4 tests are by requirements targeted for Java 5 already.</p>

                <p>Change the parser to ANTLR3 which is better performant, LL* lookahead capable and
                    processes whitespace in a better manner than ANTLR2 which we currently are
                    using.</p>
                <p>Maybe use gunit for testing?</p>
