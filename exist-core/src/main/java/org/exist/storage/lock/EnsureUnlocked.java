/**
 * An annotation for indicating that no locks
 * must be held on parameters to a method, or on return types.
 *
 * As well as explicitly expressing intention, this annotation can be used
 * with {@link EnsureLockingAspect} to compile into the code runtime checks
 * which will enforce the locking policy.
 *
 * Typically this is used with parameters of type {@link org.exist.collections.Collection}
 * and {@link org.exist.dom.persistent.DocumentImpl}.
 *
 * If this annotation is
 * used on an {@link org.exist.xmldb.XmldbURI} then a {@code type} value must
 * also be provided to indicate the type of the lock identified by the uri.
 *
 * For example we may indicate that Collection parameters to methods
 * should not be locked:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public LockedCollection lockCollection(@EnsureUnlocked final Collection collection) {
 *
 *    ...
 *
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
