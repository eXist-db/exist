/**
 * An annotation for indicating that no locks
 * must be held on the containing object before
 * a method may be called.
 *
 * As well as explicitly expressing intention, this annotation can be used
 * with {@link EnsureLockingAspect} to compile into the code runtime checks
 * which will enforce the locking policy.
 *
 * Typically this is used on methods within implementations of {@link org.exist.collections.Collection}
 * and {@link org.exist.dom.persistent.DocumentImpl}.
 * The typical use is to ensure that a container holds no locks (by URI)
 * when calling the method accessors on their internal state.
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public class MyCollectonImpl implements Collection {
 *     final XmldbURI uri;
 *     public MyCollectionImpl(final XmldbURI uri) {
 *         this.uri = uri;
 *     }
 *
 *     public XmldbURI getUri() {
 *         return uri;
 *     }
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     @EnsureContainerUnlocked
 *     public int dirtyCountDocuments() {
 *         return documents.size();
 *     }
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
