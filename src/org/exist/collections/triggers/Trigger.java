/**
 * Defines the base interface for collection triggers. Triggers are registered through the
 * collection configuration file, called "collection.xconf", which should be
 * stored in the corresponding database collection. If a collection configuration file is
 * found in the collection, it will be parsed and any triggers will be created and configured.
 * The {@link #configure(DBBroker, Collection, Map) configure} method is called once on each trigger.
 * 
 * Triggers listen to events. Currently, there are five events to which triggers may be
 * attached:
 * 
 * <table border="0">
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td>{@link #STORE_DOCUMENT_EVENT}</td>
 * 		<td>Fired, if a new document is inserted into the collection.</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td>{@link #UPDATE_DOCUMENT_EVENT}</td>
 * 		<td>Fired, whenever an existing document is updated, i.e. replaced
 * 		with a new version.</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td>{@link #REMOVE_DOCUMENT_EVENT}</td>
 * 		<td>Fired, whenever a document is removed from the collection.</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * <tr>
 *      <td>{@link #RENAME_COLLECTION_EVENT}</td>
 *      <td>Fired, before a collection is renamed.</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *      <td>{@link #CREATE_COLLECTION_EVENT}</td>
 *      <td>Fired, before a new collection is created.</td>
 *  </tr>
 * </table>
 * 
 * The document-related events are handled by the sub-interface {@link org.exist.collections.triggers.DocumentTrigger},
 * collection-related events are handled by {@link org.exist.collections.triggers.CollectionTrigger}.
 * 
 * The collection configuration file looks as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
 * &lt;exist:collection xmlns:exist="http://exist-db.org/collection-config/1.0"&gt;
 *	&lt;exist:triggers&gt;
 *		&lt;exist:trigger event="store"
 *		class="fully qualified classname of the trigger"&gt;
 *			&lt;exist:parameter name="parameter-name"
 *				value="parameter-value"/&gt;
 *		&lt;/exist:trigger&gt;
 *	&lt;/exist:triggers&gt;
 * &lt;/exist:collection&gt;
 * </pre>
