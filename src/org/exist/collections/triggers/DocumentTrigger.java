/**
 * Interface for triggers that react to document-related events.
 * 
 * Document triggers may have two roles:
 * 
 * <ol>
 *  <li>before the document is stored, updated or removed, the trigger's {@link #prepare(int, DBBroker,Txn, XmldbURI, DocumentImpl) prepare} 
 *  method is called. The trigger code may take any action desired, for example, to ensure referential
 *  integrity on the database, issue XUpdate commands on other documents in the database...</li>
 *  <li>the trigger also functions as a filter: the trigger interface extends SAX {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler content handler} and
 *  {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler lexical handler}. It will thus receive any SAX events generated by the SAX parser. The default
 *  implementation just forwards the SAX events to the indexer, i.e. the output content handler. However,
 *  a trigger may also alter the received SAX events before it forwards them to the indexer, for example,
 *  by applying a stylesheet.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * The DocumentTrigger interface is also called for binary resources. However, in this case, the trigger can not function as
 * a filter and the SAX-related methods are useless. Only {@link #prepare(int, DBBroker, Txn, XmldbURI, DocumentImpl)} and
 * {@link #finish(int, DBBroker, Txn, XmldbURI, DocumentImpl)} will be called. To determine if the document is a binary resource,
 * call {@link org.exist.dom.DocumentImpl#getResourceType()}.
 * 
 * The general contract for a trigger is as follows:
 * 
 * <ol>
 *  <li>configuration phase: whenever the collection loads its configuration file, the trigger's 
 *  {@link #configure(DBBroker, Collection, Map) configure} method
 *  will be called once.</li>
 *  <li>pre-parse phase: before parsing the source document, the collection will call the trigger's
 *  {@link #prepare(int, DBBroker, Txn, XmldbURI, DocumentImpl) prepare} 
 *  method once for each document to be stored, removed or updated. The trigger may
 *  throw a TriggerException if the current action should be aborted.</li>
 *  <li>validation phase: during the validation phase, the document is parsed once by the SAX parser. During this
 *  phase, the trigger may decide to throw a SAXException to report a problem. Validation will fail and the action
 *  is aborted.</li>
 *  <li>storage phase: the document is again parsed by the SAX parser. The trigger will still receive all SAX events,
 *  but it is not allowed to throw an exception. Throwing an exception during the storage phase will result in an
 *  invalid document in the database. Use {@link #isValidating() isValidating} in your code to check that you're
 *  in validation phase.</li>
 *  <li>finalization: the method {@link #finish(int, DBBroker, Txn, XmldbURI, DocumentImpl)} is called. At this point, the document
 *  has already been stored and is ready to be used or - for {@link #REMOVE_DOCUMENT_EVENT} - has been removed.
 *  </li>
 * </ol>
