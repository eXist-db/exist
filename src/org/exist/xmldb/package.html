		eXist's implementation of the XML:DB API.

		eXist has two driver implementations: the first
		uses XML-RPC calls to communicate with a remote
		database, the second talks directly to an embedded
		database instance. The driver class {@link org.exist.xmldb.DatabaseImpl}
		determines dynamically which driver should be used by
		looking at the XML:DB URI provided.
