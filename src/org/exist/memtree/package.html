	Package memtree implements a fast, in-memory DOM tree, which is used by eXist for the
	nodes created inside an XQuery expression.

	The code is an adoption of the tinytree implementation found in Michael H. Kay's
	Saxon. The implementation should be very memory efficient: the data for every node in the document
	node tree is stored in the document object itself, using simple arrays.
