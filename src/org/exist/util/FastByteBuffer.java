/**
 *  Copied this class from Xalan and adopted it for eXist. Bare-bones, unsafe,
 *  fast string buffer. No thread-safety, no parameter range checking, exposed
 *  fields. Note that in typical applications, thread-safety of a StringBuffer
 *  is a somewhat dubious concept in any case. <p>
 *
 *  Note that Stree and DTM used a single FastStringBuffer as a string pool, by
 *  recording start and length indices within this single buffer. This minimizes
 *  heap overhead, but of course requires more work when retrieving the data.
 *  <p>
 *
 *  FastStringBuffer operates as a "chunked buffer". Doing so reduces the need
 *  to recopy existing information when an append exceeds the space available;
 *  we just allocate another chunk and flow across to it. (The array of chunks
 *  may need to grow, admittedly, but that's a much smaller object.) Some excess
 *  recopying may arise when we extract Strings which cross chunk boundaries;
 *  larger chunks make that less frequent. <p>
 *
 *  The size values are parameterized, to allow tuning this code. In theory,
 *  Result Tree Fragments might want to be tuned differently from the main
 *  document's text. <p>
 *
 *  %REVIEW% An experiment in self-tuning is included in the code (using nested
 *  FastStringBuffers to achieve variation in chunk sizes), but this
 *  implementation has proven to be problematic when data may be being copied
 *  from the FSB into itself. We should either re-architect that to make this
 *  safe (if possible) or remove that code and clean up for
 *  performance/maintainability reasons. <p>
