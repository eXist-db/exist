 * being immutable: as a minimum, the caller is required to ensure that the array
 * contents will not change so long as the CharSlice remains in existence.
 *
 * This class should be more efficient than String because it avoids copying the
 * characters unnecessarily.
 *
 * The methods in the class don't check their arguments. Incorrect arguments will
 * generally result in exceptions from lower-level classes.
