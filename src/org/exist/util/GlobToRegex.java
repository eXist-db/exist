/**
 * Translates a glob expression into a Java regular expression.
 * 
 * The following syntax is supported for glob expressions:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li> <b>*</b> - Matches zero or more instances of any character.  If the
 *          STAR_CANNOT_MATCH_NULL_MASK option is used, <b>*</b> matches
 *          one or more instances of any character.
 * <li> <b>?</b> - Matches one instance of any character. If the
 *          QUESTION_MATCHES_ZERO_OR_ONE_MASK option is used, <b>?</b>
 *          matches zero or one instances of any character.
 * <li> <b>[...]</b> - Matches any of characters enclosed by the brackets.
 *          <b> * </b> and <b>?</b> lose their special meanings within a
 *          character class.  Additionaly if the first character following
 *          the opening bracket is a <b>!</b> or a <b>^</b>, then any
 *          character not in the character class is matched.  A <b>-</b>
 *          between two characters can be used to denote a range.  A
 *          <b>-</b> at the beginning or end of the character class matches
 *          itself rather than referring to a range.  A <b>]</b> immediately
 *          following the opening <b>[</b> matches itself rather than
 *          indicating the end of the character class, otherwise it must be
 *          escaped with a backslash to refer to itself.
 * <li> <b>\</b> - A backslash matches itself in most situations.  But
 *          when a special character such as a <b>*</b> follows it, a
 *          backslash <em> escapes </em> the character, indicating that
 *          the special chracter should be interpreted as a normal character
 *          instead of its special meaning.
 * <li> All other characters match themselves.
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Please remember that the when you construct a Java string in Java code,
 * the backslash character is itself a special Java character, and it must
 * be double backslashed to represent single backslash in a regular
 * expression.</p>
 * 
 * <p>The original code is adapted from the jakarta ORO package.</p>
