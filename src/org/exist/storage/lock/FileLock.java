/**
 * Cooperative inter-process file locking, used to synchronize access to database files across
 * processes, i.e. across different Java VMs or separate database instances within one
 * VM. This is similar to the native file locks provided by Java NIO. However, the NIO
 * implementation has various problems. Among other things, we observed that locks
 * were not properly released on WinXP.
 * 
 * FileLock implements a cooperative approach. The class attempts to write a lock file
 * at the specified location. Every lock file stores 1) a magic word to make sure that the
 * file was really written by eXist, 2) a heartbeat timestamp. The procedure for acquiring the
 * lock in {@link #tryLock()} is as follows:
 * 
 * If a lock file does already exist in the specified location, we check its heartbeat timestamp.
 * If the timestamp is more than {@link #HEARTBEAT} milliseconds in the past, we assume
 * that the lock is stale and its owner process has died. The lock file is removed and we create
 * a new one.
 * 
 * If the heartbeat indicates that the owner process is still alive, the lock
 * attempt is aborted and {@link #tryLock()} returns false.
 * 
 * Otherwise, we create a new lock file and start a daemon thread to periodically update
 * the lock file's heart-beat value.
