 * Class to keep track of all running queries in a database instance. The main
 * purpose of this class is to signal running queries that the database is going to
 * shut down. This is done through the {@link org.exist.xquery.XQueryWatchDog}
 * registered by each query. It is up to the query to check the watchdog's state.
 * If it simply ignores the terminate signal, it will be killed after the shutdown
 * timeout is reached.
