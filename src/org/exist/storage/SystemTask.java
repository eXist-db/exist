 * or throws an exception. Any exception will be caught and a warning
 * written to the log.
 * 
 * A task can be scheduled for execution

 * {@link org.exist.scheduler.Scheduler}.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: SystemTask implementations should avoid to acquire
 * locks on collections! Doing so may lead to a deadlock situation.
 * The system task runs in a privileged mode. Locking collections
 * and resources is not required as no other transactions will be
 * taking place.
