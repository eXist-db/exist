## XML Serialization options for the WevDAV
## The file is read from the classpath
## Be careful changing the default values !
#indent=yes
#expand-xincludes=no
#process-xsl-pi=no
#encoding=UTF-8
omit-xml-declaration=yes
omit-original-xml-declaration=no
output-doctype=yes

## Due to the way eXist-db stores XML, the exact size of an XML document when
## it is serialized (e.g., sent to a WebDAV client) may vary depending upon
## serialization parameters.
##
## For performance reasons, eXist by default only reports an approximate file size
## for XML documents. (eXist reports accurate sizes for binary documents,
## which aren't subject to serialization parameters.)
##
## The approximate size is a good indication of the size of document
## but some WebDAV clients, in particular the macOS Finder version, can
## not deal with this estimate, resulting in incomplete or overcomplete
## documents.
##
## To address these various possibilities, two system variables can be set
## to change the way the size is calculated.
##
## Supported values are APPROXIMATE, EXACT, NULL
##
## PROPFIND:
## Unfortunately both NULL and APPROXIMATE do not work for
## macOS Finder. The default behaviour for the Finder 'user-agent' is
## exact, for the others it is approximate.
##
## GET:
## The NULL value seems to be working well for macOS too.
##
## The system properties are:
## -Dorg.exist.webdav.PROPFIND_METHOD_XML_SIZE=..  (used for listing documents in collection)
## -Dorg.exist.webdav.GET_METHOD_XML_SIZE=...      (used during download of one document)
##
## Supported values are:
## NULL         - document sizes are NOT reported                              [Alternative]
## EXACT        - document sizes are reported using document pre-serialization [Slow]
## APPROXIMATE  - document sizes are reported as (pagesize * number of pages)  [Default]
##
## Depending on the WebDAV client needs, one or both properties can be set.
#
# org.exist.webdav.PROPFIND_METHOD_XML_SIZE=APPROXIMATE
# org.exist.webdav.GET_METHOD_XML_SIZE=NULL
