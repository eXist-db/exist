Define a new method of creating objects for use by Javascript.
We don't just allow access to any object and some may need special code to
get a reference to them.

@attr id The unique name by which create elements refer to us.

Define a new way of converting between javascript objects and java objects.
Many classes can have default conversion mechanisms but some require more
custom conversion

<!--
Allow the creation of a class, and give it a name in javascript land.
A reference to a creator is required as are some parameters specific to each
creator that define the objects it allows creation of.
It would be nice to make the creator and IDREF rather than a CDATA, since it
refers to an element defined elsewhere, however we allow multiple dwr.xml
files and we might refer to one in another file.

Some elements (currently only create although there is no hard reason why
convert elements should not be the same) need customization in ways that we
can't predict now, and this seems like the only way to do it.

A creator can allow and disallow access to the methods of the class that it
contains. A Creator should specify EITHER a list of include elements (which
implies that the default policy is denial) OR a list of exclude elements

Allow conversion of a class between Java and Javascript.
A convert element uses a previously defined converter and gives a class match
pattern (which can end with *) to define the classes it allows conversion of

refers to an element defined elsewhere, however we allow multiple dwr.xml
files and we might refer to one in another file.
