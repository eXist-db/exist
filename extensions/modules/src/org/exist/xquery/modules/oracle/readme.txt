Oracle module for eXist-db
==========================

This module requires the presence of an Oracle JDBC driver. An appropriate 
driver can be obtained as a JAR file from the Oracle Corporation at
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index.html

The JAR file should be placed in EXIST_HOME/lib/user folder.

This module also requires the SQL extension module to be built and enabled 
in EXIST_HOME/conf.xml as it shares some common functionality.

The module has been tested with an Oracle 10.2.0.4 database using the 
ojdbc14.jar driver archive.
