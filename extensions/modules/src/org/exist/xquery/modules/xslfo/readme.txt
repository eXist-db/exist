This module relies on the presence of Apache FOP and as such you will need to add the following jar files to your EXIST_HOME/lib/user folder -

fop.jar
batik-all-1.6.jar
xmlgraphics-commons-1.2.jar

This has been tested with Apache FOP 0.9.4, and the jar files are available from http://mirror.public-internet.co.uk/apache/xmlgraphics/fop/fop-0.94-bin-jdk1.4.zip
