JMX management interface for eXist
----------------------------------

NOTE: This is work in progress and incomplete. Needs Java 5
or newer.

The classes in this package provide access to various
management interfaces (so called MBeans) available within 
a running eXist database. The service is based on Java 
Management eXtensions (JMX). It can be used with
standard JMX tools like jconsole. We also provide a
simple command-line utility included in this package.

To enable the JMX agent in eXist, call

./build.sh -f tools/jmx/build.xml

to compile the part of the source code which depends
on the javax.management packages. This will add a bunch
of classes to exist.jar.

Next, you have to tell the Java vm which is running the server
to open a port for JMX. This is done through a set of properties
passed on the command line. For example:

-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=1099
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false

The shell and .bat scripts that ship with eXist do already include
the necessary lines. You just have to uncomment them.

Once the server process is restarted, you can use any JMX client
to access the JMX services. The included command line client is
useful to get a quick overview of certain server statistics. For
example, to view the current cache usage, run

java -jar start.jar org.exist.management.JMXClient -s
