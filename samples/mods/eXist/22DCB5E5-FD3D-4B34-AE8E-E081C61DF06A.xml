    <abstract>eXist provides its own XQuery implementation, which is backed by an efficient
        indexing scheme at the database core to support quick identification of structural node
        relationships. eXist's approach to XQuery processing can thus not be understood without
        knowing the indexing scheme and vice versa. Over the past years, two different indexing
        schemes for XML documents were implemented in eXist: while the first was based on an
        extended level-order numbering scheme, we recently switched to hierarchical node ids to
        overcome the limitations imposed by the former approach. The presentation provides a
        quick overview of these developments. I will try to summarize the logic behind both
        indexing schemes we implemented in eXist, and point out their strengths and deficencies.
        Based on this foundation, we should have a look at some central aspects of XQuery
        processing and optimization.</abstract>
