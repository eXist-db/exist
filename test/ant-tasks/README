------------------------
eXist AntUnit testcases
------------------------

These testcases contain integration/functional/regression 
tests of eXists Ant tasks. It uses the Apache antunit library.


------------------------
Dependencies
------------------------

* Ant 1.7.0 Beta 2 or later.
http://ant.apache.org

* antunit.jar (easy to just put in ant /lib)
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/antlibs/antunit/trunk/

* eXist's /db/test collection, which is installed by default 

------------------------
Organisation
------------------------

exist.properties contains configurable parameters

common.xml: contains common ant datatypes shared by other files

antunit.xml: is antunit test runner.
    
base.xml: test existence of each Ant task class and low level artifacts

file.xml: test file functions

server.xml: test shutdown, back & restore

user.xml: tests user functions

xmldb.xml: tests xmldb functions


------------------------
Setting up and Running
------------------------

Step 1) adjust exist.properties to reflect your test instance of eXist

Step 2) startup eXist (easy to automate this as well, but I left it)

Step 3) ensure antunit.jar is in Ant lib directory are accessible to Ant

Step 4) run ant on antunit.xml with All target e.g.

ant -f antunit.xml All


------------------------
Rationale
------------------------

If one looks at these tests and thinks 'these are not unit tests'...I would agree
which is why I described them more as functional tests...note they are still useful
as unit tests in a regression sense which is where I think there is value with respect
to the eXist XMLDB project.

A good (and short) arguement for using antunit can be found here;
