eXist AntUnit testcases
------------------------

These testcases contain integration/functional/regression 
tests of eXists Ant tasks. It uses the Apache antunit library.

Deps
----

* Ant 1.7.0 Beta 2 or later.
http://ant.apache.org

* antunit.jar (placed in ant /lib)
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/antlibs/antunit/trunk/

Layout
------

exist.properties contains configurable parameters

common.xml: contains common ant datatypes shared by other files

antunit.xml: is antunit test runner.
    
base.xml: test existence of each Ant task class and low level artifacts

file.xml: test file functions

server.xml: test shutdown, back & restore

user.xml: tests user functions

xmldb.xml: tests xmldb functions


Installation
------------

org.exist.ant.AntUnitTestRunner runs these tests via eXist normal junit tests

to run the tests manually

1) adjust exist.properties to reflect your test instance of eXist

2) manually startup eXist

3) ensure antunit.jar is in Ant lib directory are accessible to Ant

4) run ant on antunit.xml with default Target ('run')


Rationale
---------

A good (and short) arguement for using antunit can be found here;
